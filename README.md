# Planeswalker Arena
This is a little personal project the retreads ground already covered by others, I however want to learn a bit of python and flask, whilst having something I can deploy and use when playing a bit of MTG with the homies. 
Aesthetically its a bit prettier than some of the ones I have used which was really the entire reason for it.

Don't look to closely at the codebase, its pure function over quality and isn't really intended for people to deploy themselves and use but if you want to, for whatever reason...
